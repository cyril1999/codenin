of '!'
here, b=20
inside the 'if' parentheses, would've been considered as true if not
for the '!'sign which flips any non-zero value to zero thus not allowing
the control to enter into the if statement.
i.e. !b==0 which is false. '!' plays the perfect role of flipping
th truth value of a statement.

e.g. a=0; !a== non-zero value which allows the code inside the 
if statement to get executed
